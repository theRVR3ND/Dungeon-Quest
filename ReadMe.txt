-----------------------------------|Starting the Journey|----------------------------------

When the program is launched, a menu will be displayed. Each of the four player buttons 
corresponds to a single hero. Each is randomized, so each run will have a random hero tied 
to each buttons, with the four used heros being chosen from six total. Clicking a button 
will display the hero and the hero's name. When the game is launched, only the selected 
heros will be able to play. At least one hero must be selected in order for the game to be 
played.

----------------------------------|Exploring the Dungeon|----------------------------------

The game is click-based for movement. Each player's turn cycles throughout the game, 
starting with the top-left player and advancing clockwise. For a turn, a hero can perform
several actions.

	Move: Clicking to a direction (up, left, right, down) relative to a hero will cause
	the hero to move, if possible. If they encounter a wall, they will not move and the
	turn will not advance (it is still your turn).
